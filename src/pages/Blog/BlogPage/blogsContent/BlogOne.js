      <p>
        In the age of post covid, most movie teams communicate asynchronously.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want that kind of communication to be effective, you need to
        choose the right tools.
      </p>
      <p>
        Picking the right tool is easier said than done — there are so many team
        and instant messaging apps out there. And, looking at all the lists of
        the most popular apps can get overwhelming pretty fast.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this article, I’ll do a comparison of the the most popular
        communication app WhatsApp and Crafter Teams
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ll compare Crafter Teams and WhatsApp in the following categories:
      </p>
      <div className="innerPtag">
        <p>1. Pricing</p>
        <p>2. User interface</p>
        <p>3. Communication</p>
        <p>4. Notifications</p>
        <p>5. Search</p>
        <p>6. File sharing and storage</p>
        <p>7. Video calls</p>
        <p>8. Support</p>
        <p>9. Security</p>
      </div>
      <p>Crafter vs WhatsApp overview</p>
      <p>WhatsApp is among the most popular communication apps.</p>
      <p>What’s the difference between the two?</p>
      <p>
        Crafter is a team messaging app. Movie studios mainly will use it for
        internal business communication. It will have a user-friendly interface
        and offer a wide range of features — from file sharing to integrating
        movie production related apps — it comes as no surprise that it’ll be
        one of the most used collaboration tools in the movie industry.
      </p>
      <p>
        WhatsApp is also an instant messaging app. While it can be used for
        business, people mainly use it to keep in touch with their family and
        friends. It can also be used for communication within a team.
      </p>
      <p>
        It supports sending and receiving a variety of media, as well as making
        voice and video calls.
      </p>

      </div>
      <h3 className="decMarBottom">Crafter vs WhatsApp user interface 1:1</h3>
      <p>Crafter Teams has a simple and user-friendly interface.</p>
      <p>
        Conversations take the majority of the screen, while on the sidebar you
        can see all your channels, threads, and people you’ve chatted with.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can also change the color of the sidebar, and the changes will
        automatically apply to the mobile app too.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even if you’ve never used Crafter Teams before, you’d probably find what
        you need with no trouble.
      </p>
      <p>
        WhatsApp Business App has the same interface as the original WhatsApp
        app — a list of conversations that you click on to see the messages,
        with the addition of product catalogs.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can pick your own chat background or use one of those offered in the
        app.
      </p>
      <p>It’s elegant, as well as quite intuitive and easy to use.</p>
      <p>
        Both have a simple UI that’s easy to navigate and get used to — so both
        apps get a point.
      </p>
      <h3>Crafter vs WhatsApp communication 1:1</h3>
      <p>
        Crafter Teams has many useful features that facilitate team
        communication — such as:
      </p>
      <div className="innerPtag">
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Organizing conversations into channels</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Sharing files</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Scheduling messages</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Creating polls</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Search option</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Editing and deleting messages</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Emojis and GIFs</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Formatting messages</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <p>
        WhatsApp has many features up its (metaphoric) sleeve too — for example:
      </p>
      <p>File sharing</p>
      <p>Location sharing</p>
      <p>Voice messages</p>
      <p>Temporary images and text messages</p>
      <p>Group chats</p>
      <p>
        Seeing if the other person has seen your message and when they were last
        active
      </p>
      <p>Search option</p>
      <p>
        As you can see, both apps have a plethora of options that will
        facilitate your daily communication.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, there are some features that both apps have — but that’s not the
        case for all features.
      </p>
      <p>
        For instance, you can schedule and edit messages only on Crafter Teams
        which is needed while working with a team
      </p>
      <p>
        And, you can share locations and check if your message is seen
        exclusively on WhatsApp.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because of that, it’s up to you to decide what features are more
        valuable to you and your team — hence, both apps get a point.
      </p>

        Crafter Teams vs WhatsApp notifications 1:0
      </h3>
      <p>Generally, you get notifications on Crafter Teams when:</p>
      <div className="innerPtag">
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>You get a direct message from someone</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Someone mentions you</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>You get a reply on a thread you’re following</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>You receive a message from Crafter Team’s bot</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <p>
        But, our app will have advanced notification options — it’s up to you
        whether you’ll receive all notifications, some of them, or none.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can also pick a time frame in which you’ll receive notifications or
        choose to be notified on your mobile device if you’re inactive on the
        desktop. Work life balance
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, you can activate Do not disturb mode and work
        notifications-free for a time period of your choice.
      </p>
      <p>
        WhatsApp also has a couple of notification preferences — but they’re not
        nearly as customizable as Crafter Teams’s.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you want to focus on work, you can mute chats for 8 hours, 1 week,
        or forever
      </p>
      <p>
        Since Crafter Teams has more sophisticated notification options, it’s
        the champion of this category.
      </p>
      <div className="imagDiv">
        <img src={third} alt="blogsimages" />
      </div>
      <h3 className="decMarBottom">Crafter Teams vs WhatsApp search 1:0</h3>
      <p>
        Crafter Teams will have quite advanced search options — you can search
        for:
      </p>
      <div className="innerPtag">
        <p>Messages</p>
        <p>Files</p>
        <p>People</p>
        <p>Channels</p>
      </div>
      <p>
        You can even pick a certain period or exclude some channels from your
        search, as well as search within documents.
      </p>
      <p>In WhatsApp, you can:</p>
      <p>Search conversations with a keyword</p>
      <p>
        Search media (photos, videos, links, GIFs, audio, and documents) by
        using filters
      </p>
      <p>
        View media of choice — for instance, you can see all the photos shared
        in one conversation
      </p>
      <p>
        Again, more advanced options guaranteed Crafter Teams a win in this
        round.

        Crafter Teams vs WhatsApp audio and video calls 1:0
      </h3>
      <p>
        The free version of Crafter Teams offers you 1-on-1 video and voice
        calls, while the paid version allows you to add up to 15 participants.
        You can also:
      </p>
      <p>Share your screen</p>
      <p>Let others draw on your screen</p>
      <p>Share the mouse control</p>
      <p>Record meetings</p>
      <p>
        WhatsApp also has video and voice call options for up to 8 participants,
        all for free.
      </p>
      <p>
        But, the kicker is — this option is only available on mobile devices and
        not on WhatsApp Web.
      </p>
      <p>
        That won’t be a problem if your team is often on the go — but for more
        serious, sit-down meetings, WhatsApp is not the best solution.
      </p>
      <p>
        Better options and more participants make Crafter Teams a winner once
        again.
      </p>
      <div className="imagDiv">

      <h3 className="decMarBottom">
        Crafter Teams vs WhatsApp file sharing and storage 1:0
      </h3>
      <p>
        Crafter Teams will support all kinds of files, from PDF documents to
        video and audio files.
      </p>
      <p>
        They can be uploaded from your device or via file-sharing apps, such as
        Dropbox or Google Drive.
      </p>
      <p>When it comes to file storage, it depends on the plan you choose:</p>
      <p>Free plan: 5GB for the entire workspace</p>
      <p>Pro plan: 10GB per member</p>
      <p>Business plan: 20GB per member</p>
      <p>Enterprise Grid plan: 1TB per member</p>
      <p>As always, the more you invest, the more you’ll get.</p>
      <p>On WhatsApp, you can share:</p>
      <p>Images</p>
      <p>Videos</p>
      <p>Audio files</p>
      <p>Locations</p>
      <p>Contacts</p>
      <p>Documents</p>
      <p>
        The only catch is — there is a limit of 100MB per file on Android and
        128MB on iOS.
      </p>
      <p>
        When it comes to storage, WhatsApp is not a storage medium — it uses up
        the space on your phone and cloud.
      </p>
      <p>
        Again, Crafter Teams wins this round as it supports more types of files
        and ways to upload them.
      </p>

        If you purchased the Business+ plan, you also have 24/7 support with 4

      <p>
        The Enterprise Grid plan additionally offers you tailored support with a
        designated account and customer success team.
      </p>
      <p>That’s hard to beat — but let’s see what WhatsApp offers.</p>

      <p>As you’ve already guessed — Crafter Teams wins.</p>
      <h3 className="decMarBottom">Crafter Teams vs WhatsApp security 1:1</h3>
      <p>
        Last, but definitely not least, we have to consider how protected your
        data is on these two apps. Data security should not be taken lightly,
        especially since business communication can contain confidential
        information like scripts, story boards etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        Crafter Teams plans to encrypt data at rest and data in transit. It will
        also have many security certifications, such as:
      </p>
      <p>ISO/IEC 27001</p>
      <p>SOC 2</p>
      <p>CSA</p>
      <p>However, Crafter Teams doesn’t have end-to-end encryption.</p>
      <p>
        WhatsApp, on the other hand, has strong end-to-end encryption for both
        individual and group chats. Messages are also protected by Signal
        encryption.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unlike the majority of apps, data encryption is enabled on all chats by
        default — you don’t have to manually turn it on.
      </p>
      <p>
        But, WhatsApp shares some information with its parent company, Meta.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since both apps have their pros and cons in regards to security, we’ll
        go with 1:1 in this round.
      </p>
      <div className="imagDiv">

      <h3>Crafter Teams vs WhatsApp final verdict</h3>
      <div className="imagDiv">
        <img src={eight} alt="blogsimages" />
      </div>
      <p>The answer is (drum roll) Crafter Teams.</p>
      <p>However, that doesn’t mean that WhatsApp is not worth using.</p>
      <p>
        Both apps are popular for a reason and contain many features that will
        help your team communicate better and be more productive.
      </p>
      <p>It all boils down to what your team needs:</p>
      <p>
        Crafter Teams is better for internal work communication.within your
        team.
      </p>
      <p>Thanks</p>
