        Of the many elements that make up a strong portfolio , two of the most
        important ones are your profession and “About” section.

        and it’s one of the first things people see when they visit your

      <h3 className="decMarBottom">Crafter Portfolio checklist</h3>
      <p>
        While your profile summary holds major emphasis, you’ll need to spend
        time on savvying up the rest of it.
      </p>
      <p>Here’s a quick checklist of the basics to help you get started:</p>
      <div className="innerPtag">
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong> Upload your photo.</strong> Ideally, this should be done
              in professional attire. Profiles with photos are 14 times more
              likely to be viewed,
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong> Customize your public name.</strong> The name should look
              something like: Jessica Yan This will make it easier for you to be
              found on Crafter app.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Enhance your profile with additional sections.</strong>
              Displaying further information (e.g., accomplishments, skills,
              volunteer experience, certifications, expertise) can also increase
              the amount of times people view your profile, . This, in turn, can
              help you build your network and connect to new opportunities.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong> Education:</strong> Include, in reverse chronological
              order, any programs or schools you went to.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong> Do not miss your “profession” section.</strong>
              Ensuring a relevant list of profession on your profile allows
              others in your network to endorse you. (Skills with the most
              endorsements will be listed first). This will also help others
              understand your strengths and match you with the right
              opportunities.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <h3 className="decMarBottom">
        Be an active member and build your network
      </h3>
      <p>
        Remember, the more active you are, the better. So as you move on to new
        projects or master new skills, make it a point to update your portfolio.
      </p>
      <p>
        Being active also means engaging with your community. You can do this
        by:
      </p>
      <div className="innerPtag">
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Sharing updates .</strong> This should only include
              projects you’ve worked on that people in your network may want to
              read.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>
                Inviting past and current coworkers, classmates, to connect.
              </strong>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>

              <strong>
                Engaging with your connections’ “Recent Activity.”
              </strong>
              Crafter allows you to see what folks in your network are
              publishing. If they shared a recent project that you enjoyed
              reading, for example, why not send him a message with a nice
              comment?
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Follow more people</strong>
              This will help you strengthen connections with people who share
              common skills, experiences, industry affiliations and goals.
