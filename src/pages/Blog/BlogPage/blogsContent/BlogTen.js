        1. Where do they find the resources? (camera, editing, talent) Quite
        often when I hear any of my friends or contacts shoot a film, I hear
        they do A LOT of borrowing. Their school owns a latest camera that is
        usually used for shooting school performances, etc. It’s the same for
        the editing equipment. Their film school just has some VERY simple Avid
        editing stations that they bought on a whim, so they use those. As for
        talent, it really boils down to whoever they can find. Friends,
        teachers, etc. The problem here is that these people usually have busy
        schedule’s, so they end up working on their time. When it comes to
        things like this, never get discouraged if something doesn’t work out in
        the way of equipment, talent, etc. If they don’t have the money to buy
        the equipment, I wish they find someone who has what they need and see
        if their willing to loan or rent it to them. Get it anyway they can,
        (legally of course..

        2. How do they pick locations? When it comes to locations and sets for
        films, web series the same technique as above applies. BORROW, BORROW,
        BORROW. First check if theirr living area is good for a shoot, or their
        or their family owns something that will work. That is the easiest. If
        they don’t have a location that will work, ask their neighbors, friends,
        etc. If they don’t, drive around and look for the right place. If they
        end up finding it, and they don’t know the people who own it, ask them
        for permission to use the area. More than likely they will with little
        or no money value attached. If they need a soundstage, they may want to
        ask the local music venue or performing arts theatre. These places are
        great, as they come with equipment too. The only problem is that they
        USUALLY won’t let you use it unless you rent it. And the costs for
        renting stages is not cheap. But it may be their only choice.

        3. Where do they find actors? As stated before, they use people they
        know. At this point, they don’t worry about acting abilities. They teach
        their actors on the spot, show them what they know. Just keep going over
        and over the script if they can’t act out a certain part. They should
        get it eventually.

        4. Where do they get the money to make videos? All the money they use
        would be out of their own pockets . THEY GET CREATIVE! Every so often,
        they may want to find a sponsor if they’re doing a BIG film. Somebody
        who will pay them for displaying or using their product. This may come
        in very handy, but sponsor contracts often have a lot strings attached.

        5. Where can they show their film/video? Once they are done with their
        film/video, they want people to see it! This can be done in a few ways.
        The first and easiest idea is to show a bunch of their friends, and have
        them spread the word about it. Before you know it, more and more people
        will be wanting to see your piece of art. Another way to get your name
        out there is the internet. Capture your film on a computer and hand it
        out all over. Crafter app is a great place to start. They are very
        stringent on their choices for films, but if you can get in there,
        you’re going to be exposed twice as fast.
