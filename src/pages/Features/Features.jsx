          Threaded messages are essentially that. You can use threaded messages
          in Crewsâ€™s channels, direct messages, and Apps. In each of these
          instances, there are ways to utilise threaded messages effectively to
          benefit you and your team.

        <p>
          For example, an assistant director wants a weekly update on casting;
          they can ask in either the #casting channel to their team or directly
          message someone. In both instances, there is an option to add a
          threaded message as a reply.
