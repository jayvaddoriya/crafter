      "Threaded messages are a list of comments that roll up to an initial or parent message. Once a message has replies, it becomes a parent message. Any child messages of that parent message are called threaded replies. The whole bundle of a parent message and its replies is referred to as a thread. Each of the messages within a thread, whether parent or reply, is a threaded message. The most straightforward example where you might see this is Facebook’s reply option on someone’s post.",
