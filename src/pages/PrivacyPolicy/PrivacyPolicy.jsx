        <h3>Effective date: 5 March 2023</h3>
        <p>
          This Privacy Policy describes how Crafter collects, uses and discloses
          information associated with an identified or identifiable individual
          (referred to in this Privacy Policy as ‘Personal Data’) and what
          choices you have around this activity. If you have any questions,
          please don’t hesitate to contact us.
        </p>
        <p className="marginBottom">
          When we refer to ‘Crafter’, we mean Totoro Technologies Private
          Limited, as explained in more detail in the ‘Identifying the data
          controller and processor’ section below.
        </p>
        <h3>Applicability of this Privacy Policy</h3>
        <p>
          This Privacy Policy applies to Crafter’s online workplace productivity
          tools and platform, including the associated Crafter mobile and
          desktop applications (collectively, the ‘Services’), Crafter.co.in and
          other Crafter websites (collectively, the ‘Websites’) and other
          interactions (e.g. customer service enquiries, user conferences, etc.)
          that you may have with Crafter. If you do not agree with this Privacy
          Policy, then do not access or use the Services, Websites or any other
          aspect of Crafter’s business. For the avoidance of doubt, this is the
          only privacy policy that applies to Crafter.
          <br />
          This Privacy Policy does not apply to any third-party applications or
          software that integrate with the Services through the Crafter platform
          (‘Third-Party Services’), or any other third-party products, services
          or businesses who will provide their services under their own terms of
          service and privacy policy. In addition, a separate agreement governs
          delivery, access and use of the Services (the ‘Customer Agreement’),
          including the processing of data such as messages, files or other
          content submitted through Services accounts (collectively, ‘Customer
          Data’). The organisation (e.g. your employer or another entity or
          person) that entered into the Customer Agreement (the ‘Customer’)
          controls its instance of the Services (its ‘Workspace’) and any
          associated Customer Data. If you have any questions about specific
          Workspace settings and privacy practices, please contact the Customer
          whose Workspace you use. I If you have received an invitation to join
          a Workspace but have not yet created an account, you should request
          assistance from the Customer that sent the invitation.
        </p>
        <h3>Information we collect and receive</h3>
        <p>
          Crafter will collect and receive information through operating the
          Services and Websites, and through other interactions with Crafter.
          Such information will include Customer Data and other information and
          data (‘Other Information’) in a variety of ways:
        </p>
        <div className="innerOtherText">
          <ul>
            <li>
              Customer Data. Customers or individuals granted access to a
              Workspace by a Customer (‘Authorised Users’) routinely submit
              Customer Data (such as messages, files or other content submitted
              through Services accounts) to Crafter when using the Services.
            </li>
            <li>
              Other Information. Crafter also collects, generates and/or
              receives the following categories of Other Information:

            <li>
              <span>Workspace and account information:</span> To create or
              update a Workspace account, you or our Customer (e.g. your
              employer) supply Crafter with an email address, phone number,
              password, domain and/or other account set-up details (for more
              detail on Workspace creation, click here. In addition, Customers
              that purchase a paid version of the Services provide Crafter (or
              its payment processors) with billing details such as credit card
              information, banking information and/or a billing address.
            </li>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Services metadata. When an Authorised User interacts with the
                  Services, metadata is generated that provides additional
                  context about the way that an Authorised User uses the
                  Services. For example, Crafter logs the Workspaces, channels,
                  people, features, content and links that you view or interact
                  with, the types of files shared and what Third-Party Services
                  are used (if any).
                </li>
                <li>
                  Log data. As with most websites and technology services
                  delivered over the Internet, our servers automatically collect
                  information when you access or use our Websites or Services
                  and record it in log files. This log data may include your
                  Internet Protocol (IP) address, the address of the web page
                  that you visited before using the Website or Services, browser
                  type and settings, the date and time that the Services were
                  used, information about browser configuration and plugins, and
                  your language preferences.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Device information. Crafter collects information about devices
                  accessing the Services, including type of device, what
                  operating system is used, device settings, application IDs,
                  unique device identifiers and crash data. Whether we collect
                  some or all of this Other Information often depends on the
                  type of device used and its settings.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Location information. We receive information from you, our
                  Customers and other third parties that helps us to approximate
                  your location. We may, for example, use a business address
                  submitted by your employer (who is our Customer) or an IP
                  address received from your browser or device to determine
                  approximate location to assist with localisation or for
                  security purposes.

              <span>Cookie information:</span> Crafter uses a variety of cookies
              and similar technologies in our Websites and Services to help us
              collect Other Information. For more details about how we use these
              technologies, and your opt-out controls and other options, please

            </li>
            <li>
              <span>Third-Party Services information:</span> A Customer can
              choose to permit or restrict Third-Party Services for its
              Workspace and Crafter can receive personal data from such
              Third-Party Services. Typically, Third-Party Services are software
              that integrate with our Services, and a Customer can permit its
              Authorised Users to enable and disable these integrations for its
              Workspace (for more details on third-party application management,
              settings and permissions, ). Crafter may also develop and offer
              Crafter applications that connect the Services with a Third-Party
              Service. Once enabled, the provider of a Third-Party Service may
              share certain information with Crafter. For example, if a cloud
              storage application that you are using is enabled to permit files
              to be imported to a Workspace, we may receive the user name and
              email address of Authorised Users, along with additional
              information that the application makes available to Crafter to
              facilitate the integration. Authorised Users should check the
              privacy settings and notices in these Third-Party Services to
              understand what data may be disclosed to Crafter. When a
              Third-Party Service is enabled, Crafter is authorised to connect
              and access Other Information made available to Crafter in
              accordance with our agreement with the provider of the Third-Party
              Service and any permission(s) granted by our Customer (including
              by its Authorised User(s)). Examples of information which Crafter
              may receive in this manner include whether you successfully
              created a new account or interacted with a third-party application
              in a way that is attributable to Crafter usage activity. We do
              not, however, receive or store passwords for any of these
              Third-Party Services when connecting them to the Services. 
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>Contact information:</span> In accordance with the consent
              process provided by your device or other third-party API, any
              contact information that an Authorised User chooses to import
              (such as importing an address book to find colleagues and Crafter
              Connect contacts or calendar from a device or API), forward or
              upload to the Services (for example, when sending emails to the
              Services) is collected when using the Services.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>Third-party data:</span> Crafter may receive data about
              organisations, industries, lists of companies that are customers,
              website visitors, marketing campaigns and other matters related to
              our business from parent corporation(s), affiliates and
              subsidiaries, our partners or others that we use to make our own
              information better or more useful. This data may be combined with
              Other Information that we collect and might include
              aggregate-level data, such as which IP addresses correspond to
              postcodes or countries. Or it might be more specific: for example,
              how well an online marketing or email campaign performed.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>Audio and video metadata:</span> Crafter may receive,
              capture and store metadata derived from your use of features such
              as Crafter huddles or clips, and additional related data such as
              data regarding the date and time of your Crafter huddle and the
              Authorised User that you connected with.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span> Additional information provided to Crafter: </span> We also
              receive Other Information when submitted to our Websites or in
              other ways, such as responses or opinions that you provide if you
              participate in a focus group, contest, activity or event, feedback
              that you provide about our products or services, information that
              you provide if you apply for a job with Crafter, enrol in a
              certification programme or other educational programme hosted by
              Crafter or a vendor, request support, interact with our social
              media accounts or otherwise communicate with Crafter.

          Generally, no one is under a statutory or contractual obligation to
          provide any Customer Data or Other Information (collectively
          “Information”). However, certain Information is collected
          automatically and if some Information, such as Workspace setup
          details, is not provided, we may be unable to provide the Services.
        </p>
        <h3>
          How we process your information and our legal bases for doing so
        </h3>
        <p>
          Customer Data will be used by Crafter in accordance with a Customer’s
          instructions, including to provide the Services, any applicable terms
          in the Customer Agreement, a Customer’s use of Services functionality
          and as required by applicable law. Crafter is a processor of Customer
          Data and the Customer is the controller. The Customer may, for
          example, use the Services to grant and remove access to a Workspace,
          assign roles and configure settings, access, modify, export, share and
          remove Customer Data, and otherwise apply its policies to the
          Services.
          <br />
          Crafter uses Other Information to operate our Services, Websites and
          business. More specifically, Crafter uses Other Information for the
          following purposes:
        </p>
        <h3>Compliance with a legal obligation:</h3>
        <p>
          Crafter processes Other Information when we comply with a legal
          obligation including, for example, to access, preserve or disclose
          certain information if there is a valid legal request from a
          regulator, law enforcement or others. For example, a search warrant or
          production order from law enforcement to provide information in
          relation to an investigation, such as your profile picture or IP
          address.
          <br />
          We use Workspace and account information, usage information, cookie
          information, Third-Party Services information, contact information,
          third-party data, audio and video metadata, and additional information
          provided to Crafter for compliance with a legal obligation.

          We rely on our legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of a
          third party where they are not outweighed by your interests or
          fundamental rights and freedoms (‘legitimate interests’).

              Korea and the United States, to provide, update, maintain and
              protect our Services, Websites and business.For more information,

          This section describes how Crafter may share and disclose Information,
          as described in the section entitled ‘Information we collect and
          receive’ above. Customers determine their own policies and practices
          for the sharing and disclosure of Information to third parties.
          Crafter does not control how a Customer or any third party chooses to
          share or disclose Information.

              The Customer’s instructions. Crafter may share and disclose
              Information in accordance with a Customer’s instructions and with
              appropriate consent, including any applicable terms in the
              Customer Agreement and the Customer’s use of Services
              functionality and in compliance with applicable law and legal
              process. Some sharing at a Customer’s request may incur additional

                To enable Crafter to follow our Customers’ instructions, Crafter
                provides several administrator controls to allow Customers to
                manage their Workspaces. For example, we follow our Customers’
                instructions to enable or disable Authorised Users’ use of
                various features of the Services, such as clips or Crafter
                huddles, channel posting permissions, the sharing and visibility
                of direct messages including files, or whether and how
                Authorised Users can connect with other organisations’
                Workspaces through Crafter Connect.

          guarantee that Information during transmission through the Internet or
          while stored on our systems or otherwise in our care will be
          absolutely safe from intrusion by others. When you click a link to a
